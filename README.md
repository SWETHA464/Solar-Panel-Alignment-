# 🌞 Automated Solar Alignment System for Electricity Generation  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Automated Solar Alignment System** is designed to optimize solar energy collection by dynamically adjusting the solar panel’s position based on the **sun’s direction**. The system uses **light-dependent resistors (LDRs)** to detect light intensity and a **servo motor controlled by an Arduino** to move the panel towards the strongest light source. This ensures **maximum power generation throughout the day** without requiring manual adjustments.

## 🔧 Components Used  
- **Arduino Uno** – Microcontroller for processing sensor data and controlling the servo motor  
- **Light-Dependent Resistors (LDRs)** – Detects sunlight intensity to determine the sun’s direction  
- **Servo Motor** – Rotates the solar panel for optimal alignment  
- **Resistors** – Regulates voltage and current to protect components  
- **Jump Wires** – Connects circuit components  
- **Breadboard** – Used for easy prototyping and circuit assembly

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Sunlight Detection:** The **LDR sensors** continuously measure light intensity from different directions.  
2. **Data Processing:** The **Arduino Uno** reads the LDR values and determines the direction of the most intense sunlight.  
3. **Panel Adjustment:** The **servo motor** rotates the solar panel towards the direction with the highest light intensity.  
4. **Continuous Tracking:** The system keeps adjusting the panel throughout the day for optimal sunlight exposure.
